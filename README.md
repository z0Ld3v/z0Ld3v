# Hi, I'm z0L👋🏾

## About Me 🚀
I'm a passionate security researcher and web3 developer specializing in blockchain technologies.

My focus is on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in decentralized systems, ensuring that the future of finance and governance is secure and resilient. With experience in both smart contract development and security, I bring a balanced perspective to creating and auditing dApps.

I believe that thorough manual review is the cornerstone of effective smart contract security. I complement my analysis with tools like Slither and Aderyn to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of my work. This combined approach allows me to uncover potential security risks while maintaining a deep understanding of the code.

## Skills 💼
- **Languages**: Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Foundry or HardHat
- **Testing & Security Tools**: Slither, Aderyn

## Professional Development 🌱
I specialize in both secure development and security analysis of smart contracts, combining my skills to build and protect decentralized applications. My focus areas include security patterns in smart contract design, common vulnerabilities and exploits in smart contracts, and advanced testing techniques for decentralized applications. As a developer, I work to implement best practices in Solidity, creating code that's both efficient and resilient.

I believe in sharing knowledge and contributing to the community, so you'll find a mix of personal projects, tutorials, and resources here on my GitHub. Whether I'm writing a new dApp or conducting a detailed audit, I aim to provide insights that strengthen web3 security.

As I continue to grow in this space, I look forward to collaborating with others who share the same commitment to secure, innovative blockchain solutions.
