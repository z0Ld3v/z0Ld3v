Hi, I'm z0L👋🏾

I'm a passionate security researcher specializing in web3 and blockchain technologies. My focus is on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in decentralized systems, ensuring that the future of finance and governance is secure and resilient.

I believe that thorough manual review is the cornerstone of effective smart contract security. I complement my manual analysis with tools like Slither and Aderyn to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of my work. This combined approach allows me to uncover potential security risks while maintaining a deep understanding of the code.

I'm currently focused on:

**Smart Contract Audits**: Conducting detailed manual reviews and utilizing static analysis tools to secure smart contracts.
**Security Research**: Exploring emerging trends and technologies within the decentralized ecosystem.

I believe in sharing knowledge and contributing to the community, so you'll find a mix of personal projects, tutorials, and resources here on my GitHub. As I continue to grow in this space, I look forward to collaborating with others who share the same commitment to security and innovation.

Let's build a safer decentralized future together.
