Hi, I'm z0L👋🏾

I'm a passionate security researcher specializing in web3 and blockchain technologies. My focus is on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in decentralized systems, ensuring that the future of finance and governance is secure and resilient.

I've spent a significant amount of time diving deep into Solidity, smart contract vulnerabilities, and security best practices. I'm continuously refining my skills by exploring complex security challenges and staying updated with the latest developments in the blockchain space.

I'm currently focused on:

Smart Contract Security: Analyzing and securing smart contracts to protect against various attack vectors.
Web3 Research: Exploring emerging trends and technologies within the decentralized ecosystem.
Tool Development: Creating and contributing to tools that enhance the security and efficiency of smart contract auditing.
I believe in sharing knowledge and contributing to the community, so you'll find a mix of personal projects, tutorials, and resources here on my GitHub. As I continue to grow in this space, I look forward to collaborating with others who share the same commitment to security and innovation.

Let's build a safer decentralized future together.
